# Responsive

This is assignment 2 of Full Stack Coding Bootcamp

Responsive elements at 400, 768, and 992 pixel widths. 

4 pages: 
  -index.html 
  -portfolio.html 
  -contact.html 
  -style.css 
  
Images in Assets folder (N.B. I originally had them linked to my page http://karlypaige.com but the links were all broken. So instead I just downloaded the jpgs and put them in a file which worked for my site, but I am not sure why image web links didn't work.)
